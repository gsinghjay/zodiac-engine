# Progress: Zodiac Engine

## What Works

- **Core FastAPI Application**: Basic app setup (`app/main.py`) with CORS, configuration, and error handling.
- **API Routing**: Versioned API structure (`/api/v1/`) with endpoints for charts.
- **Natal Chart Calculation**: Endpoint (`/api/v1/charts/natal/`) successfully calculates natal charts using Kerykeion via `AstrologyService`.
- **Chart Visualization (Natal & Synastry)**: Endpoints (`/api/v1/charts/visualization/...`) generate and save SVG charts using `ChartVisualizationService`.
- **SVG Serving**: Generated SVGs are stored in `app/static/images/svg` and can be accessed via static file serving.
- **Configuration Options**: Visualization endpoints accept configuration for themes, languages, zodiac type, houses, points, and aspects.
- **Dependency Injection**: Basic DI implemented for settings (`app.core.dependencies`).
- **Testing**: A suite of tests exists (`tests/`) covering various chart calculations, configurations, and variations using `pytest` and `TestClient`.
- **Basic Documentation**: OpenAPI documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI.
- **CI/CD**: Semantic Release is configured via GitHub Actions.

## What's Left to Build / Improve

- **API Structure Refactoring**: Implement the planned migration from `endpoints/` to `routers/` (See `docs/api-structure-migration-plan.md`).
- **FastAPI Best Practices Implementation**: Apply updates outlined in `docs/fastapi-best-practices-updates.md`:
  - Update `requirements.txt` (remove `fastapi[all]`, pin versions).
  - Modernize Pydantic models (v2 syntax, `model_config`).
  - Enhance Dependency Injection (use `Annotated`, inject services).
  - Review and fix Async/Sync consistency.
  - Improve Error Handling (use `fastapi.status`, review handlers).
  - Optimize API Responses (`response_model_exclude_unset`).
  - Implement Performance Optimizations (Background Tasks, Caching).
- **Implement Placeholder Endpoints**: Complete the functionality for `/composite` and `/transit` chart endpoints.
- **Database Integration**: Consider adding a database for storing user data, generated chart metadata, or caching results.
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Implement if user-specific features are needed.
- **LLM Interpretations**: Future goal to add AI-powered interpretations.
- **Advanced Scoring**: Implement more sophisticated relationship scoring beyond basic synastry aspects.

## Current Status

- **Core functionality**: Natal chart calculation and visualization are implemented and tested.
- **Synastry visualization**: Implemented and tested.
- **Refactoring Planned**: API structure refactoring is planned and documented.
- **Best Practice Updates Planned**: A detailed plan exists for further aligning with FastAPI best practices.
- **Memory Bank**: Initialized.

## Known Issues

- **`fastapi[all]` Dependency**: Needs replacement with specific dependencies.
- **Pydantic v1 Syntax**: Models use older syntax (`Optional`, `List`, `Dict`, `class Config`).
- **Static Service Methods**: Services use static methods, hindering testability and flexibility (DI needed).
- **Potentially Inconsistent Async Usage**: Requires review.
- **Geonames Dependency**: Requires `GEONAMES_USERNAME` for online timezone lookups, currently defaulted to offline mode in the service.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Initial Setup**: Focused on integrating Kerykeion and providing core natal chart functionality via FastAPI.
- **Visualization Added**: Implemented SVG generation and static file serving.
- **Configuration Enhanced**: Added more options to customize chart generation.
- **Testing Implemented**: Added a comprehensive test suite.
- **Best Practices Review**: Identified areas for improvement based on latest FastAPI standards.
- **API Structure Refactoring Decision**: Decided to adopt the `routers/` convention for better organization and alignment with community practices.
