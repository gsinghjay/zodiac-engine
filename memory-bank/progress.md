# Progress: Zodiac Engine

## 1. What Works

- **Web Interface**: 
  - User-friendly web interface for generating both Western and Vedic charts.
  - Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices.
  - Form-based input for birth details and chart configuration.
  - Background task processing for chart generation.
  - Display of generated SVG charts.
  - Tab-based interface for switching between Western and Vedic chart types.
  
- **Core Application**: Stable FastAPI application setup.
- **API Routing**: Modern, resource-based routing implemented in `app/api/v1/routers/`.
- **Natal Chart Calculation**: `/api/v1/charts/natal` endpoint functions correctly, returning basic `NatalChartData`.
- **Chart Visualization (SVG)**:
  - `/api/v1/charts/visualization/natal` endpoint successfully generates, saves, and returns the URL for natal chart SVGs.
  - `/api/v1/charts/visualization/synastry` endpoint successfully generates, saves, and returns the URL for synastry chart SVGs.
- **Placeholder Endpoints**: Basic structure exists for Composite and Transit chart endpoints (returning placeholders).
- **Service Layer**: Business logic encapsulated in `AstrologyService` and `ChartVisualizationService` using instance methods and dependency injection.
- **Configuration**: Robust configuration management via `.env` and Pydantic `Settings` class.
- **Dependencies**: Updated and managed via `requirements.txt`.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite (25 tests) covering all implemented functionality, all passing.
- **Best Practices**: Codebase adheres to documented FastAPI best practices (Pydantic v2, DI, async/sync, error handling, etc.).

## 2. What Needs Improvement / Is Left to Build

- **Web Interface Enhancements**:
  - Add validation for form inputs on the client side.
  - Add more detailed explanations and tooltips for chart configuration options.
  - Implement user feedback during chart generation (progress indicators).
  - Create dedicated views for different chart types beyond natal charts.

- **Natal Chart Expansion Plan** (Next Priority):
  - **Enhanced Models**: Update `NatalChartResponse` schema (`app/schemas/chart.py`) to include detailed astrological data (planets, houses, aspects, elements, qualities, lunar phase, etc.).
  - **Service Logic**: Update `AstrologyService` to extract and populate the enhanced data from Kerykeion objects.
  - **API Update**: Ensure the `/api/v1/charts/natal` endpoint uses the enhanced response model.
- **Implement Placeholder Endpoints**: Add actual calculation/visualization logic for:
  - Composite Charts
  - Transit Charts
- **Database Integration (Future)**: Implement a database layer for persistence (users, saved charts, settings).
- **Advanced Scoring (Future)**: Implement more complex relationship scoring (beyond basic synastry aspects).
- **LLM Interpretations (Future)**: Integrate LLM for generating textual interpretations of charts.
- **Caching (Future)**: Implement caching for expensive calculations.
- **Authentication/Authorization (Future)**: Add user management if needed.

## 3. Current Status

- **Web Interface Implemented**: A functional web interface has been added to provide a user-friendly way to generate astrological charts.
- **Refactoring Complete**: The major refactoring effort to implement FastAPI best practices and migrate the API structure (`endpoints/` -> `routers/`) is finished.
- **Stable & Tested**: The application is stable, and all 25 tests are passing.
- **Ready for Next Phase**: The codebase is prepared for the implementation of the Natal Chart Expansion Plan.

## 4. Known Issues

- **GeoNames Configuration**: The application is currently unable to correctly read the `GEONAMES_USERNAME` from the `.env` file, causing the `GeoService` to fall back to the demo account, which frequently exceeds its rate limit. This prevents city/timezone lookups from working reliably.
- **Web Interface**: 
  - SVG generation may take a few seconds, requiring users to refresh the page if they access the chart URL too quickly.
  - No client-side validation for form inputs yet.
  
- None currently identified in the API. Previous issues related to dependencies, syntax, and test setup have been resolved during the refactoring process.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Web Interface Addition**: Implemented a server-side rendered web interface using Jinja2 templates to provide a user-friendly way to interact with the API.
- **Initial Setup**: Basic FastAPI app with initial Kerykeion integration.
- **Service Layer Introduction**: Abstracted logic into service classes (initially static methods).
- **Best Practices Refactoring**: Significant effort to align with modern FastAPI standards.
- **API Structure Migration**: Reorganized API endpoints from `endpoints/` to `routers/`.
- **Configuration Debugging**: Investigated issues with `.env` file loading using `pydantic-settings`, adding specific logging to `GeoService` to diagnose the problem.
- **Current Focus**: Resolving the `GEONAMES_USERNAME` configuration issue before proceeding with the Natal Chart Expansion Plan.
