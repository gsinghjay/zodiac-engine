# Progress: Zodiac Engine

## 1. What Works

- **Web Interface**: 
  - Bootstrap-powered responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices.
  - User-friendly web interface for generating both Western and Vedic charts.
  - Form-based input for birth details and chart configuration.
  - Background task processing for chart generation.
  - Dedicated chart details page with download options for different file formats.
  - Share functionality with copyable URL.
  - Tab-based interface for switching between Western and Vedic chart types.
  - Location search with auto-complete functionality.
  - Form validation with instant feedback.
  - House system mapping to correctly translate human-readable names to Kerykeion codes.
  - Language code conversion for proper display of charts.
  
- **Core Application**: Stable FastAPI application setup.
- **API Routing**: Modern, resource-based routing implemented in `app/api/` with proper versioning. Both API and web routes are now consolidated under the same directory tree.
- **Natal Chart Calculation**: `/api/v1/charts/natal` endpoint functions correctly, returning basic `NatalChartData`.
- **Chart Visualization (SVG)**:
  - `/api/v1/charts/visualization/natal` endpoint successfully generates, saves, and returns the URL for natal chart SVGs.
  - `/api/v1/charts/visualization/synastry` endpoint successfully generates, saves, and returns the URL for synastry chart SVGs.
  - Chart image display in the dedicated chart details page.
  - Basic download options (currently all serving SVG files).
- **Chart Data Storage**: Simple in-memory cache for storing chart data.
- **Placeholder Endpoints**: Basic structure exists for Composite and Transit chart endpoints (returning placeholders).
- **Service Layer**: Business logic encapsulated in `AstrologyService` and `ChartVisualizationService` using instance methods and dependency injection.
- **Configuration**: Robust configuration management via `.env` and Pydantic `Settings` class.
- **Dependencies**: Updated and managed via `requirements.txt`.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite covering all implemented functionality, all passing.
- **Best Practices**: Codebase adheres to documented FastAPI best practices (Pydantic v2, DI, async/sync, error handling, etc.).
- **Router Structure**: Consolidated and improved to follow FastAPI best practices, with all routes now under the `app/api/` directory.

## 2. What Needs Improvement / Is Left to Build

- **Download Options Enhancement** (Immediate Priority):
  - Implement actual SVG to PNG conversion functionality
  - Implement SVG to PDF conversion functionality
  - Add proper file type detection and content-type headers

- **Chart Data Persistence**:
  - Implement a more robust solution for chart data persistence beyond the in-memory cache
  - Consider using a database for storing chart data and user preferences
  - Add expiration times for generated charts

- **UI Improvements**:
  - Add more interactive elements using Bootstrap's components
  - Enhance form validation with clearer error messages
  - Add tooltips for chart options and configurations

- **Natal Chart Expansion Plan**:
  - **Enhanced Models**: Update `NatalChartResponse` schema (`app/schemas/chart.py`) to include detailed astrological data (planets, houses, aspects, elements, qualities, lunar phase, etc.).
  - **Service Logic**: Update `AstrologyService` to extract and populate the enhanced data from Kerykeion objects.
  - **API Update**: Ensure the `/api/v1/charts/natal` endpoint uses the enhanced response model.
- **Implement Placeholder Endpoints**: Add actual calculation/visualization logic for:
  - Composite Charts
  - Transit Charts
- **Database Integration (Future)**: Implement a database layer for persistence (users, saved charts, settings).
- **Advanced Scoring (Future)**: Implement more complex relationship scoring (beyond basic synastry aspects).
- **LLM Interpretations (Future)**: Integrate LLM for generating textual interpretations of charts.
- **Caching (Future)**: Implement caching for expensive calculations.
- **Authentication/Authorization (Future)**: Add user management if needed.

## 3. Current Status

- **Bootstrap Implementation Complete**: Successfully migrated the web interface from custom CSS to Bootstrap for improved responsiveness and consistency.
- **Dedicated Chart Details Page Added**: Implemented a dedicated page for chart viewing with download options and share functionality.
- **Chart Generation Flow Improved**: Modified the chart generation process to redirect to the dedicated chart details page.
- **Bug Fixes Implemented**: Resolved issues with routing and template rendering to ensure a smooth user experience.
- **UI Refined**: Updated form elements, navigation, and layout using Bootstrap components.
- **Bug Fixes Implemented**: Successfully resolved issues with house system mapping and language code handling, ensuring proper chart generation.
- **UI Simplified**: Removed the preview chart feature to focus on the core functionality and improve user experience.
- **GeoService Improved**: Fixed method naming and added async support to ensure location search works correctly.
- **Router Structure Refactoring Completed**: Successfully consolidated the router structure to follow FastAPI best practices.
- **Web Interface Implemented**: A functional web interface has been added to provide a user-friendly way to generate astrological charts.
- **Refactoring Complete**: The major refactoring effort to implement FastAPI best practices and migrate the API structure (`endpoints/` -> `routers/`) is finished.
- **Stable & Tested**: The application is stable, and all tests are passing.
- **Ready for Next Phase**: The codebase is prepared for download options enhancement, followed by the Natal Chart Expansion Plan.

## 4. Known Issues

- **Chart Download Formats**: Currently, all download options (SVG, PNG, PDF) return the SVG file as actual file format conversion is not yet implemented.
- **In-Memory Cache**: The chart data cache is not persistent across server restarts and could cause memory issues with many entries.
- **Template URL Generation**: Using direct URL paths in templates instead of url_for to avoid routing issues.
- **Web Interface**: 
  - Limited help text and tooltips for astrological options.
  - Mobile experience could be improved further.
  
- None currently identified in the API. Previous issues related to dependencies, syntax, and test setup have been resolved during the refactoring process.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Bootstrap Adoption**: Migrated from custom CSS to Bootstrap to improve UI consistency, responsiveness, and development speed.
- **Dedicated Chart Page**: Implemented a separate chart details page to provide a better viewing experience and additional options.
- **In-Memory Caching**: Implemented a simple dictionary-based cache for chart data as a quick solution, with plans for a more robust solution later.
- **Direct URL Paths**: Switched from url_for to direct URL paths in templates to avoid routing issues.
- **UI Simplification**: Decided to remove the preview chart feature to simplify the user experience and reduce server load, focusing on the primary chart generation functionality.
- **Library Compatibility Improvements**: Added mapping systems and conversion functions to ensure compatibility with the Kerykeion library's expected input formats, resolving issues with house systems and language codes.
- **Router Structure Improvement**: Successfully consolidated web routes from `app/routers/` into `app/api/web.py`, aligning with FastAPI best practices. This creates a more consistent project structure with all routing in a single directory tree.
- **Web Interface Addition**: Implemented a server-side rendered web interface using Jinja2 templates to provide a user-friendly way to interact with the API.
- **Initial Setup**: Basic FastAPI app with initial Kerykeion integration.
- **Service Layer Introduction**: Abstracted logic into service classes (initially static methods).
- **Best Practices Refactoring**: Significant effort to align with modern FastAPI standards.
- **API Structure Migration**: Reorganized API endpoints from `endpoints/` to `routers/`.
- **Current Focus**: Enhancing download options before proceeding with the Natal Chart Expansion Plan.
