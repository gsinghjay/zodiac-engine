## 4. Known Issues

- **No Caching for LLM Responses**: Gemini API responses aren't cached, which could lead to unnecessary API costs for repeated interpretations of the same chart.

- **Limited Error Handling for Specific API Failures**: While general error handling is in place, more specific handling for rate limits and other API-specific errors could be improved.

- **In-Memory Cache**: The chart data cache is not persistent across server restarts and could cause memory issues with many entries.

- **Template URL Generation**: Using direct URL paths in templates instead of url_for to avoid routing issues.

- **Web Interface**: 
  - Limited help text and tooltips for astrological options.
  - Mobile experience could be improved further with more responsive adjustments.

- **HTMX Implementation**:
  - Limited to basic interactions; more complex patterns not yet implemented.
  - No websocket/SSE support for real-time continuous updates.
  
- Previous issues related to dependencies, syntax, test setup, and house system mapping have been resolved. The GeoService async/sync pattern inconsistency and chart report functionality issues are now fixed.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Markdown Formatting Approach**: Chose to use the Python markdown library to convert LLM-generated Markdown to HTML rather than having the LLM generate HTML directly or displaying raw Markdown. This approach provides better separation of concerns, reliable formatting, and easier styling with CSS while being less taxing for the LLM.

- **Sync Service with Threadpool Pattern**: Chose to make the GeoService methods synchronous and use run_in_threadpool in async routes, since the underlying requests_cache.CachedSession is synchronous. This approach maintains the existing functionality while fixing the misleading API and preventing potential issues.

- **Frontend-First LLM Integration**: Decided to implement all UI components and API structure for LLM integration before connecting to an actual LLM provider, enabling testing and refinement of the user experience without API costs.

- **Multi-Provider LLM Support**: Designed the LLM integration to support multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) to give users flexibility and future-proof the implementation.

- **LLM Settings Structure**: Created comprehensive environment variable configuration for LLM integration including provider selection, model name, API key, and caching options.

- **LLM Integration Priority**: Shifted focus to LLM chart interpretations as a top priority after implementing the report generation foundation that will supply structured data to the LLM.

- **Report Integration Approach**: Decided to implement the report generation service before LLM interpretation to provide structured data that can be easily formatted as prompts.

- **File Conversion Approach**: Selected CairoSVG as the primary conversion solution due to its excellent support for SVG standards, with Pillow for additional JPEG conversion capability.

- **CSS Variable Handling**: Implemented preprocessing for CSS variables to ensure correct rendering across all output formats, as many conversion libraries don't fully support modern CSS features.

- **DPI Configuration**: Made DPI configurable via a query parameter to give users control over resolution quality and file size.

- **HTMX Adoption**: Integrated HTMX to enhance the user experience with dynamic interactions while maintaining a server-rendered approach, avoiding the complexity of full JavaScript frameworks.

- **Bootstrap Adoption**: Migrated from custom CSS to Bootstrap to improve UI consistency, responsiveness, and development speed.

- **Dedicated Chart Page**: Implemented a separate chart details page to provide a better viewing experience and additional options.

- **In-Memory Caching**: Implemented a simple dictionary-based cache for chart data as a quick solution, with plans for a more robust solution later.

- **Direct URL Paths**: Switched from url_for to direct URL paths in templates to avoid routing issues.

- **UI Simplification**: Decided to remove the preview chart feature to simplify the user experience and reduce server load, focusing on the primary chart generation functionality.

- **Library Compatibility Improvements**: Added mapping systems and conversion functions to ensure compatibility with the Kerykeion library's expected input formats, resolving issues with house systems and language codes.

- **Router Structure Improvement**: Successfully consolidated web routes from `app/routers/` into `app/api/web.py`, aligning with FastAPI best practices. This creates a more consistent project structure with all routing in a single directory tree.

- **Web Interface Addition**: Implemented a server-side rendered web interface using Jinja2 templates to provide a user-friendly way to interact with the API.

- **Initial Setup**: Basic FastAPI app with initial Kerykeion integration.

- **Service Layer Introduction**: Abstracted logic into service classes (initially static methods).

- **Best Practices Refactoring**: Significant effort to align with modern FastAPI standards.

- **API Structure Migration**: Reorganized API endpoints from `endpoints/` to `routers/`.

- **Current Focus**: Completing LLM API integration for chart interpretations.
