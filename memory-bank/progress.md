# Progress: Zodiac Engine

## What Works

- **Core FastAPI Application**: Basic app setup (`app/main.py`) with CORS, configuration, and error handling.
- **API Routing**: Versioned API structure (`/api/v1/`) with resource-based routing using the `routers/` convention (`app/api/v1/routers/`).
- **Natal Chart Calculation**: Endpoint (`/api/v1/charts/natal/`) successfully calculates natal charts using Kerykeion via `AstrologyService`.
- **Chart Visualization (Natal & Synastry)**: Endpoints (`/api/v1/charts/visualization/...`) generate and save SVG charts using `ChartVisualizationService`.
- **SVG Serving**: Generated SVGs are stored in `app/static/images/svg` and can be accessed via static file serving.
- **Configuration Options**: Visualization endpoints accept configuration for themes, languages, zodiac type, houses, points, and aspects.
- **Modern Dependency Injection**: Implemented for settings and services (`app.core.dependencies`) using Annotated and factory functions.
- **Pydantic v2 Models**: Updated schema models to use modern Pydantic v2 syntax.
- **Environment Variables**: Properly configured via .env file with robust CORS options parsing.
- **Testing**: A suite of tests exists (`tests/`) covering various chart calculations, configurations, and variations using `pytest` and `TestClient`. All 25 tests now pass.
- **Basic Documentation**: OpenAPI documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI.
- **CI/CD**: Semantic Release is configured via GitHub Actions.

## What's Left to Build / Improve

- **Complete FastAPI Best Practices Implementation**:
  - Review and fix Async/Sync consistency.
  - Improve Error Handling (review and enhance global handlers).
  - Optimize API Responses (implement `response_model_exclude_unset`).
  - Implement Performance Optimizations (Background Tasks, Caching).
- **Implement Placeholder Endpoints**: Complete the functionality for `/composite` and `/transit` chart endpoints.
- **Database Integration**: Consider adding a database for storing user data, generated chart metadata, or caching results.
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Implement if user-specific features are needed.
- **LLM Interpretations**: Future goal to add AI-powered interpretations.
- **Advanced Scoring**: Implement more sophisticated relationship scoring beyond basic synastry aspects.

## Current Status

- **Core functionality**: Natal chart calculation and visualization are implemented and tested.
- **Synastry visualization**: Implemented and tested.
- **API Structure Refactored**: The migration from `endpoints/` to `routers/` is complete and verified.
- **Fast API Best Practices**: Major updates implemented:
  - Requirements.txt updated with explicit dependencies and version constraints.
  - Pydantic models modernized to v2 syntax.
  - Static service methods converted to instance methods with proper DI.
  - Settings configured to use .env files with proper type handling.
  - CORS configuration improved with proper parsing of origins from .env.
  - Status codes using FastAPI constants.
  - Tests updated to follow the same best practices (status constants, type hints, no unnecessary async).
- **Memory Bank**: Updated to reflect recent changes.
- **All Tests Passing**: Fixed issues with the Settings class, ChartVisualizationService, and added required sample.svg file for testing.

## Known Issues

- ~~**`fastapi[all]` Dependency**: Needs replacement with specific dependencies.~~ ✅ Fixed
- ~~**Pydantic v1 Syntax**: Models use older syntax (`Optional`, `List`, `Dict`, `class Config`).~~ ✅ Fixed
- ~~**Static Service Methods**: Services use static methods, hindering testability and flexibility (DI needed).~~ ✅ Fixed
- ~~**Environment Variable Parsing**: CORS settings had issues with the allowed origins parsing.~~ ✅ Fixed
- ~~**Test Inconsistency**: Tests used async/await unnecessarily and hardcoded status codes.~~ ✅ Fixed
- **Potentially Inconsistent Async Usage**: Requires review.
- **Geonames Dependency**: Requires `GEONAMES_USERNAME` for online timezone lookups, currently defaulted to offline mode in the service.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Initial Setup**: Focused on integrating Kerykeion and providing core natal chart functionality via FastAPI.
- **Visualization Added**: Implemented SVG generation and static file serving.
- **Configuration Enhanced**: Added more options to customize chart generation.
- **Testing Implemented**: Added a comprehensive test suite.
- **Best Practices Review**: Identified areas for improvement based on latest FastAPI standards.
- **API Structure Refactoring**: Successfully implemented the migration to the `routers/` convention for better organization and alignment with community practices.
- **FastAPI Best Practices Implementation**: Incorporated modern Pydantic v2 syntax, proper dependency injection with instance methods, and other best practices from the FastAPI community.
- **Configuration Improvements**: Enhanced the Settings class to properly handle environment variables, particularly CORS allowed origins, using Pydantic v2 features and property methods for type conversion.
- **Test Environment Setup**: Added necessary test files (sample.svg) to ensure all tests pass successfully.
- **Test Modernization**: Updated tests to follow the same best practices as the application code, improving consistency and maintainability.
