## 2. What Needs Improvement / Is Left to Build

- **LLM API Integration** (TOP PRIORITY):
  - Complete the `InterpretationService` to integrate with a specific LLM provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, or Gemini)
  - Implement caching for interpretations to reduce API costs
  - Create error handling for API rate limits and failures
  - Add proper logging of API interactions
  - Create test mocks for LLM responses for unit testing

  - Update imports and ensure all tests continue to pass
  - This reorganization will improve code organization and maintainability

- **Chart Data Persistence with SQLite**:
  - Implement SQLite database for storing chart data and user preferences

## 4. Known Issues

- **LLM Integration**: Currently using placeholder implementation that needs to be connected to actual LLM API.

- **No Error Handling for LLM API Failures**: Need to implement robust error handling for when LLM API calls fail.

- **No Caching for LLM Responses**: LLM API responses aren't cached, which could lead to unnecessary API costs.

- **In-Memory Cache**: The chart data cache is not persistent across server restarts and could cause memory issues with many entries.

- **Template URL Generation**: Using direct URL paths in templates instead of url_for to avoid routing issues.

- **Web Interface**: 
  - Limited help text and tooltips for astrological options.
  - Mobile experience could be improved further with more responsive adjustments.

- **HTMX Implementation**:
  - Limited to basic interactions; more complex patterns not yet implemented.
  - No websocket/SSE support for real-time continuous updates.
  
- None currently identified in the API. Previous issues related to dependencies, syntax, and test setup have been resolved during the refactoring process.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Frontend-First LLM Integration**: Decided to implement all UI components and API structure for LLM integration before connecting to an actual LLM provider, enabling testing and refinement of the user experience without API costs.

- **Multi-Provider LLM Support**: Designed the LLM integration to support multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) to give users flexibility and future-proof the implementation.

- **LLM Settings Structure**: Created comprehensive environment variable configuration for LLM integration including provider selection, model name, API key, and caching options.

- **LLM Integration Priority**: Shifted focus to LLM chart interpretations as a top priority after implementing the report generation foundation that will supply structured data to the LLM.

- **Report Integration Approach**: Decided to implement the report generation service before LLM interpretation to provide structured data that can be easily formatted as prompts.

- **File Conversion Approach**: Selected CairoSVG as the primary conversion solution due to its excellent support for SVG standards, with Pillow for additional JPEG conversion capability.

- **CSS Variable Handling**: Implemented preprocessing for CSS variables to ensure correct rendering across all output formats, as many conversion libraries don't fully support modern CSS features.

- **DPI Configuration**: Made DPI configurable via a query parameter to give users control over resolution quality and file size.

- **HTMX Adoption**: Integrated HTMX to enhance the user experience with dynamic interactions while maintaining a server-rendered approach, avoiding the complexity of full JavaScript frameworks.

- **Bootstrap Adoption**: Migrated from custom CSS to Bootstrap to improve UI consistency, responsiveness, and development speed.

- **Dedicated Chart Page**: Implemented a separate chart details page to provide a better viewing experience and additional options.

- **In-Memory Caching**: Implemented a simple dictionary-based cache for chart data as a quick solution, with plans for a more robust solution later.

- **Direct URL Paths**: Switched from url_for to direct URL paths in templates to avoid routing issues.

- **UI Simplification**: Decided to remove the preview chart feature to simplify the user experience and reduce server load, focusing on the primary chart generation functionality.

- **Library Compatibility Improvements**: Added mapping systems and conversion functions to ensure compatibility with the Kerykeion library's expected input formats, resolving issues with house systems and language codes.

- **Router Structure Improvement**: Successfully consolidated web routes from `app/routers/` into `app/api/web.py`, aligning with FastAPI best practices. This creates a more consistent project structure with all routing in a single directory tree.

- **Web Interface Addition**: Implemented a server-side rendered web interface using Jinja2 templates to provide a user-friendly way to interact with the API.

- **Initial Setup**: Basic FastAPI app with initial Kerykeion integration.

- **Service Layer Introduction**: Abstracted logic into service classes (initially static methods).

- **Best Practices Refactoring**: Significant effort to align with modern FastAPI standards.

- **API Structure Migration**: Reorganized API endpoints from `endpoints/` to `routers/`.

- **Current Focus**: Completing LLM API integration for chart interpretations.
