# Project Brief: Zodiac Engine

## 1. Project Name

Zodiac Engine

## 2. Project Goal

To create a modern, robust, and extensible FastAPI-based API for performing various astrological calculations and generating chart visualizations.

## 3. Core Requirements

- **Astrological Calculations**: Provide accurate calculations for:
  - Natal charts
  - Synastry charts
  - Composite charts (future)
  - Transit charts (future)
- **Chart Visualization**: Generate customizable SVG visualizations for:
  - Natal charts
  - Synastry charts
- **API**: Offer a well-documented, versioned RESTful API.
- **Extensibility**: Design the system to easily accommodate new chart types, calculations, and features (like AI interpretations).
- **Best Practices**: Adhere to modern Python and FastAPI development best practices (SOLID, DRY, Testing, CI/CD).

## 4. Target Audience

- Developers building astrological applications.
- Astrologers needing calculation tools.
- Hobbyists interested in exploring astrology programmatically.

## 5. Scope

- **In Scope**: Core Kerykeion library integration, FastAPI endpoints for calculations and visualizations, basic configuration options, SVG output, API documentation, testing.
- **Out of Scope (Initially)**: User accounts, complex interpretation generation, alternative output formats (beyond SVG), advanced relationship scoring (beyond basic synastry).

## 6. Success Metrics

- API stability and performance.
- Accuracy of astrological calculations compared to Kerykeion.
- Ease of use for developers integrating with the API.
- Comprehensive test coverage.
- Positive feedback from users/integrators.
