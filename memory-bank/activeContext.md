# Active Context: Zodiac Engine

## Current Focus

- **Best Practice Alignment**: Continuing to evaluate and plan for implementing other FastAPI best practices outlined in `docs/fastapi-best-practices-updates.md`. Priorities include Pydantic v2 updates and Service Layer Dependency Injection.

## Recent Changes

- **API Structure Migration**: Successfully migrated the API layer from `app/api/v1/endpoints/` to `app/api/v1/routers/`.
  - Created new `routers` directory structure.
  - Moved all endpoint files (`natal.py`, `visualization.py`, etc.) using `git mv` to preserve history.
  - Updated all relevant `__init__.py` files (`app/api/v1/__init__.py`, `app/api/v1/routers/__init__.py`, `app/api/v1/routers/charts/__init__.py`) to reflect the new structure.
  - Verified the migration with the full test suite (`pytest`), confirming all 25 tests pass.
  - Removed the old `endpoints` directory.
- **API Structure Analysis**: Previously analyzed the current `app/api/v1/endpoints/` structure.
- **Best Practice Review**: Previously compared the current structure against FastAPI community standards and documentation.
- **Migration Plan Created**: Previously developed a detailed migration plan documented in `docs/api-structure-migration-plan.md`.
- **Memory Bank Initialization**: Previously created initial versions of all core Memory Bank files.

## Next Steps

1.  **Commit & PR**: Finalize commits and create a Pull Request for the `refactor/router` branch.
2.  **Prioritize Further Best Practices**: Decide on the next set of best practices from `docs/fastapi-best-practices-updates.md` to implement (e.g., Pydantic v2 updates, Service Layer DI).
3.  **Implement Next Best Practice**: Begin work on the next selected refactoring task.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Directory Naming**: Successfully implemented the decision to use `routers/` instead of `endpoints/`.
- **Migration Approach**: Successfully used `git mv` to preserve file history during restructuring.
- **Testing Importance**: Confirmed the importance of testing, as it verified the migration success.

## Important Patterns & Preferences

- **Follow Best Practices**: Continue adhering to documented FastAPI best practices.
- **Modularity**: Maintain clear separation of concerns between API, service, and core layers. The new structure reinforces this.
- **Documentation**: Keep project documentation (like the migration plan and Memory Bank) up-to-date. (This update is part of that).
- **Testing**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage for reliability.

## Learnings & Insights

- The migration to the `routers/` structure was successful and improved alignment with standard FastAPI patterns.
- A clear migration plan (`docs/api-structure-migration-plan.md`) was crucial for executing the refactor smoothly.
- Automated tests provided confidence in the structural changes.
- The Memory Bank continues to be essential for tracking progress and context.
