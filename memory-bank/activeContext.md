## Current Focus

- **API Structure Refinement**: The immediate focus is on restructuring the API layer (`app/api/`) to align with FastAPI best practices, specifically moving from the `endpoints/` directory structure to `routers/`.
- **Best Practice Alignment**: Continuing to evaluate and plan for implementing other FastAPI best practices outlined in `docs/fastapi-best-practices-updates.md` and `docs/api-structure-migration-plan.md`.

## Recent Changes

- **API Structure Analysis**: Analyzed the current `app/api/v1/endpoints/` structure.
- **Best Practice Review**: Compared the current structure against FastAPI community standards and documentation.
- **Migration Plan Created**: Developed a detailed migration plan documented in `docs/api-structure-migration-plan.md`.
- **Memory Bank Initialization**: Created initial versions of all core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).

## Next Steps

1. **Execute API Structure Migration**: Implement the steps outlined in `docs/api-structure-migration-plan.md` to rename `endpoints` to `routers` and update associated imports.
2. **Verify Migration**: Run tests (`pytest`) and manually verify endpoints and documentation after the restructuring.
3. **Prioritize Further Best Practices**: Decide on the next set of best practices from `docs/fastapi-best-practices-updates.md` to implement (e.g., Pydantic v2 updates, Service Layer DI).

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Directory Naming**: Decided to use `routers/` instead of `endpoints/` for API route modules to follow community convention.
- **Migration Approach**: Opted for using `git mv` to preserve file history during restructuring.
- **Testing Importance**: Emphasized the need for thorough testing after the structural changes to catch any broken imports or regressions.

## Important Patterns & Preferences

- **Follow Best Practices**: Strong preference for adhering to documented FastAPI best practices.
- **Modularity**: Maintain clear separation of concerns between API, service, and core layers.
- **Documentation**: Keep project documentation (like the migration plan and Memory Bank) up-to-date.
- **Testing**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage for reliability.

## Learnings & Insights

- The current project structure is functional but can be improved for better alignment with standard FastAPI patterns.
- A clear migration plan is essential for structural refactoring to minimize risks.
- The Memory Bank provides crucial context, especially after initialization.
