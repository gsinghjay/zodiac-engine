## Current Focus

- **Best Practice Implementation**: Implementing the FastAPI best practices as outlined in `docs/fastapi-best-practices-updates.md`. Currently focusing on Pydantic v2 updates and Service Layer Dependency Injection.

## Recent Changes

- **FastAPI Best Practices Implementation**:
  - Updated `requirements.txt` with explicit version constraints and replaced `fastapi[all]` with specific dependencies.
  - Updated the Settings class in `app/core/config.py` to use Pydantic v2 syntax and .env file integration.
  - Improved Settings class to properly handle CORS allowed origins using property method.
  - Updated main.py to use the new allowed_origins_list property for CORS configuration.
  - Converted AstrologyService from static methods to instance methods with dependency injection.
  - Fixed ChartVisualizationService by properly removing staticmethod decorator from synastry chart method.
  - Added factory functions for services in `app/core/dependencies.py`.
  - Updated Pydantic models to use v2 syntax (`| None` instead of `Optional[]`, `list[]` instead of `List[]`, etc.).
  - Updated router response codes to use `status` constants from FastAPI.
  - Added proper documentation for environment variables in README.md.
  - Created sample.svg file to make all tests pass successfully.
  - All 25 tests now passing in the test suite.

- **API Structure Migration**: Successfully migrated the API layer from `app/api/v1/endpoints/` to `app/api/v1/routers/`.
  - Created new `routers` directory structure.
  - Moved all endpoint files (`natal.py`, `visualization.py`, etc.) using `git mv` to preserve history.
  - Updated all relevant `__init__.py` files (`app/api/v1/__init__.py`, `app/api/v1/routers/__init__.py`, `app/api/v1/routers/charts/__init__.py`) to reflect the new structure.
  - Verified the migration with the full test suite (`pytest`), confirming all 25 tests pass.
  - Removed the old `endpoints` directory.
- **API Structure Analysis**: Previously analyzed the current `app/api/v1/endpoints/` structure.
- **Best Practice Review**: Previously compared the current structure against FastAPI community standards and documentation.
- **Migration Plan Created**: Previously developed a detailed migration plan documented in `docs/api-structure-migration-plan.md`.
- **Memory Bank Initialization**: Previously created initial versions of all core Memory Bank files.

## Next Steps

1. **Test FastAPI Best Practices Implementation**: Run the full test suite to make sure all the refactoring is working as expected.
2. **Commit & PR**: Create commits and submit a Pull Request for the `refactor/fastapi` branch.
3. **Continue with Best Practices**: Implement remaining best practices from `docs/fastapi-best-practices-updates.md`:
   - Complete async/sync consistency updates
   - Enhance error handling
   - Implement API response customization
   - Add performance optimizations

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Modern Dependency Injection**: Implemented modern dependency injection patterns with Annotated types.
- **Pydantic v2 Migration**: Successfully updated schema files to use modern Pydantic v2 syntax.
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Converted static service methods to instance methods with proper dependency injection.
- **Environment Variables**: Added proper .env file support with robust parsing.
- **CORS Configuration**: Implemented a clean approach using a property method to convert string origins to a list.
- **Test Environment**: Created necessary test assets to ensure proper test execution.

## Important Patterns & Preferences

- **Follow Best Practices**: Continue adhering to documented FastAPI best practices.
- **Modularity**: Maintain clear separation of concerns between API, service, and core layers.
- **Documentation**: Keep project documentation up-to-date with changes.
- **Testing**: Ensure changes maintain or improve test coverage.
- **Type Safety**: Use proper typing and Pydantic validation throughout the codebase.
- **Environment Configuration**: Single source of truth in .env files with proper parsing in Settings.

## Learnings & Insights

- The Pydantic v2 syntax is more concise and readable compared to v1.
- Proper dependency injection with instance methods provides better testability and maintainability.
- Using status code constants from FastAPI improves code readability and maintainability.
- Documenting environment variables is crucial for new developers to set up the project correctly.
- Property methods in Pydantic Settings classes provide a clean way to transform string configuration values into more complex types.
- The @staticmethod decorator should be removed when instance methods need access to self attributes.
- Test assets like sample files are important to ensure tests can run successfully in any environment.
